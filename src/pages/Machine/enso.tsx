                <p>Enso is our next generation unit, scheduled to come out in the fall of 2025.</p>
                <p>Working with the concept of raw video feedback, it is a granularly controllable machine that can create paths and swirls that conform to your movements of the controls.</p>
                <p>As with all Hypnocade machines, we will be including custom circuit-bent glitch controls to tweak the display and create raw textures that compliment the playtime of the machine.</p>
